# Open Property Core License

## Model

- **Source code** is distributed under the **Business Source License (BSL)**.
- **Use is free** if you are not a competitor (do not offer a similar commercial product) **and** your organization's annual revenue is **less than $100,000 USD**.
- **4 years** after the date of the first public release, the corresponding code converts to **Apache License 2.0** (permanently open).

This protects the project from cloud providers copying it into a commercial SaaS without contributing, while small businesses and startups use the product for free.

---

## Permitted (under BSL)

- Use, modify, and distribute the code.
- Deploy on your own premises (on-premise or your hosting).
- Use in commercial products when the revenue threshold and "non-competitor" conditions are met.

## Commercial license required

- Use in a product that competes with Open Property Core (property management platforms as the main product).
- Organizations with revenue **≥ $100,000 USD in the last 12 months** (when used for commercial purposes).

For a commercial license — contact via the repository (Issues or the indicated contact method).

## License text

The full BSL text is in [../LICENSE](../LICENSE) at the repository root. The conversion date to Apache 2.0 can be found in the README or in the LICENSE file itself.

## Compatibility with contributions

All contributions are accepted only with a signed **CLA (Contributor License Agreement)**. This allows us to use your code under BSL and later under Apache 2.0. Details — in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
