# GitHub Repository Setup

Before or after tagging v0.1.0, configure the repository on GitHub:

1. **Description:** Property and facility management framework. Self-hosted, open-core.
2. **Topics/Tags:** `property-management`, `proptech`, `open-core`, `bsl`, `self-hosted`

These improve discoverability and align with the project's positioning.
